For Task 1:

	- GET /nationapi/countries

			In the backend, you will have an SQL query on the countries table.

		 	Enable sorting / pagination. Feed directly to jdbcTemplate query with OFFSET and LIMIT parameters. Default sort by field is ID.

	- GET /nationapi/languages/{country_name}

			In the backend, you need to connect countries table with country_languages table using an INNER JOIN ****BASED ON THE ID***.

			No real pagination required here.


For Task 2:

	- GET /nationapi/maxgdppercapita/

				The aggregation is the issue... I think that the following will be good: 
				
				select country_id, max(gdp/population) from country_stats group by country_id;

				Enable sorting / pagination. 

For Task 3:

	- GET /nationapi/stats/ (for all regions)

	- GET /nationapi/stats/{region_name}

	Request params for both: dateFrom, dateTo

	Enable sorting / pagination.

	FIGURE OUT THE SQL QUERY BEFORE YOU START THE CONTROLLER.
