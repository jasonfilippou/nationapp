For Task 1:

	- GET /nationapi/countries

			In the backend, you will have an SQL query on the countries table.

		 	Enable sorting / pagination. Feed directly to jdbcTemplate query with OFFSET and LIMIT parameters. Default sort by field is ID.

	- GET /nationapi/languages/{country_name}

			In the backend, you need to connect countries table with country_languages table using an INNER JOIN ****BASED ON THE ID***.

			No real pagination required here.


For Task 2:

	- GET /nationapi/maxgdppercapita/

				The aggregation is the issue... I think that the following will be good: 
				
				select countries.name as name, max(gdp/population) as gdppercapita from countries inner join country_stats on countries.country_id = country_stats.country_id group by country_stats.country_id;

				Enable sorting / pagination. 

For Task 3:

	- GET /nationapi/stats/ (for all regions)

	- GET /nationapi/stats/{region_name}

	Request params for both: yearFrom, yearTo

	Enable sorting / pagination.


	select continents.name as continent_name, regions.name as region_name, countries.name as country_name, country_stats.year as year, country_stats.population as population, country_stats.gdp as gdp
	from continents inner join regions ON continents.continent_id = regions.continent_id inner join countries ON 
	regions.region_id = countries.region_id inner join country_stats on countries.country_id = country_stats.country_id;
